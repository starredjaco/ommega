# Ommega A-side Relay

Custom keystore implementation for remote TEE attestation relay (A-side).

This is a full keystore implementation that fully implements the AOSP AIDL
interface. It runs on the A-side device and, when remote mode is enabled,
forwards attestation / sign / decrypt to a B-side real hardware TEE through the
relay_server.

## How it works

- **Local mode** (`remote: false`): uses the bundled software keybox to mint
  attestation chains, like a regular keystore spoofer.
- **Remote mode** (`remote: true`): attestation (tag 709) is minted by the
  B-side real hardware TEE via the relay_server. Sign/decrypt for remote keys
  are forwarded too. Falls back to local when the relay is unreachable
  (`fallback_local`).

## Install and configure

**Android 12 or above required.**

1. Install this module (KernelSU/APatch, or Magisk).

2. Configure `/data/adb/ommega/ommegadata/config` (the single shared A-side
   config; `ommegadata` is a symlink to `/data/misc/keystore/ommega`, which is
   the path the daemon actually reads):

   ```
   url: http://<relay-server>:<port>
   device_id: <b-side-device-id>
   token: <relay-token>
   remote: true
   local_hw: true
   tls_insecure: true
   debug_logging: false
   ```

3. Add the apps you want to intercept to `/data/adb/ommega/ommegadata/target.txt`
   (one package per line; `!` = force generate, `?` = force patch). The WebUI
   (`webroot/`) manages this for you under KernelSU.

4. Replace the template `keybox.xml` if you want local-mode attestation with
   your own keys.

> **Path note**: `/data/adb/` is root-only, so the keystore process (uid 1017)
> cannot read `/data/adb/ommega/*` directly. The single data location is
> `/data/misc/keystore/ommega/`, exposed at `/data/adb/ommega/ommegadata`
> (a symlink created by `post-fs-data.sh`). `config` and `target.txt` are read
> from there — **nothing reads `/data/adb/ommega/config` or
> `/data/adb/ommega/target.txt`** (there is no sync/copy step; a file written
> at that path is silently ignored). Both files are watched, so edits take
> effect without a reboot.
>
> Editing by hand? Use `/data/adb/ommega/ommegadata/config`, or just toggle it
> in the module WebUI, which writes through the symlink.

### Global scope (intercept every caller)

`global_scope: true` in that same `config` file — or the checkbox in the
WebUI's remote-config dialog — makes the injector handle **every** caller: the
`scoop` list, `target.txt`, `deny_packages`, the android-package rule and the
unknown-package rule are all skipped. `[filter].enabled = false` remains the
only way to turn interception off completely.

It is re-read on every event, so toggling it takes effect immediately, with no
restart of the injector or keystore2. Whether a handled request is served
locally or by the remote relay is decided elsewhere and does **not** change
with this switch.

### Bundled PathMask kernel module (`kmod-loader.sh`)

The module ships the official PathMask `.ko` builds (see
`template/pathmask/UPSTREAM.md`) and loads one at boot from `service.sh`:

* the kernel's **major.minor** (`uname -r`, e.g. `6.1.145-android14-11` → `6.1`)
  selects the candidate; the patch level is ignored, and when a series has
  several official Android variants they are tried in order;
* the SoterService binder is probed for at most ~2 s (whole run < 3 s): if it
  answers, nothing is masked and any mask this module installed earlier is
  removed; if it does not, `/system/priv-app/SoterService` is masked with
  `scope_mode=global`;
* an already-loaded `pathmask` instance that this module did not load is left
  untouched (set `pathmask_takeover: 1` to take it over).

The WebUI switch **Mask SOTER** (flat config key `soter_hide`, off by default)
controls the whole thing: with the switch off the loader never loads the kernel
module and removes a mask of its own that is still loaded, so the service
becomes visible again. The switch has to be turned on explicitly; a config
without the key means off. Other optional keys, read from the same `config`
file:
`soter_hide_prefer: skip` (keep the path visible when the probe cannot reach the
service), `pathmask_target: <path>`, `soter_service: <comma,separated,binder/names>`,
`soter_package: <pkg>`.
For a dry run (logs decisions, never touches `/proc/modules`):
`KMOD_DRY_RUN=1 sh /data/adb/modules/ommega/kmod-loader.sh`; add
`KMOD_CONF_PATH=/path/to/config` and `KMOD_STATE_DIR=/some/scratch/dir` to test
against a scratch config without disturbing the real state.

## Restarting keymint and injector

The module ships two background daemons: one for `keymint`, one for `injector`.
Restart them with:

```sh
# only the shadow TA: keystore2 keeps running
touch /data/adb/ommega/restart.keymint
# only the injected payload: keystore2 is replaced and re-injected
touch /data/adb/ommega/restart.injector
# both
touch /data/adb/ommega/restart.all
```

**Prefer the smallest target that applies your change.** The payload inside keystore2 is
the only place that holds the framework's unlock material (the LSKF material behind
auth-bound keys), so replacing keystore2 leaves every auth-bound key init answering
`LOCKED` until the user unlocks the device again. A new `keymint` binary only needs
`restart.keymint`, which leaves that material alone; `scripts/deploy_hot_update.py`
derives the target from which binary actually changed (`--restart auto`, the default).
